To my knowledge, everything has been implemented correctly. This includes the three html pages bio.html, index.html, and resume.html. The resume is organized as an unordered list. There is one stylesheet that has more than 5 rules and there is no styling in any of the html sheets.However, in future assignments, I want to change the layout of my pages based on the size of the window. When the window size changes, some of the elements on my pages are distorted.

I collaborated with Dan Callahan.

I spent about 10 hours working on this project.
