Implementation:
To my knowledge, everything has been implemented correctly. This includes the three html pages bio.html, index.html, and resume.html. The resume is organized as an unordered list. There is one stylesheet that has more than 5 rules and there is no styling in any of the html sheets.However, in future assignments, I want to change the layout of my pages based on the size of the window. When the window size changes, some of the elements on my pages are distorted.

Some issues that I ran into include changing the position of elements in relation to other elements. Some elements overlapped with others (especially the links) which prevented the user from clicking on the link. Also, keeping tracks of rules and how they affected each page was challenging.

Collaboration:
I collaborated with Dan Callahan.

Time Spent:
I spent about 10 hours working directly on this project. This includes the actual coding, researching different styling techniques, reading over lectures, and talk to other students.
